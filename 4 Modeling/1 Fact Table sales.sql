-- We are creating a fact table of all sales transactions:

-- Each row = one transaction (customer × product × date)

-- Includes sales metrics (quantity, unit_price, total_amount)

-- Adds customer country and product category from staging tables

-- Uses LEFT JOIN so no transactions are lost

-- TRIM() fixes extra spaces in CSV IDs

-- CLUSTER BY helps queries run faster
